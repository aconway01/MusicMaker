<p>Welcome to Music Maker, where there's
everything you need to make your own music!
Start by selecting the Song Key tab. You'll 
find the chords you should use with your song 
key along with the notes in the scale to play 
and sing along with it. Don't know your chords? 
Try the Chords tab where you'll find the notes that 
all your chords consist of. Finally, use the Metronome 
tab to play your song and stay in time to the beat
of the music!
